        "ques": "Traditionally, Machine Learning runs on big servers (Python). What does **TensorFlow.js** enable?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "It allows you to define, train, and run ML models entirely in the **Browser** (using WebGL acceleration). \nThis enables privacy (data never leaves the device) and low latency (no server round-trip)."
        },
        "explanation": "You can do real-time object detection in a webcam feed directly in Chrome."

        "ques": "How do developers typically integrate **LLMs** (like GPT-4) into web apps today?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "Via **API Calls**. \nThe app sends a prompt (text) to an endpoint (e.g., OpenAI API), and the model returns the completion. Complex logic often involves **Prompt Engineering** and **Functions Calling**."
        },
        "explanation": "The heavy lifting is done by the provider; the developer acts as an orchestrator."

        "title": "Vector Databases 🧭",
        "ques": "To allow an AI to search through your own private data (RAG pattern), you use a **Vector Database** (like Pinecone). What does it store?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "It stores **Embeddings**. \nEmbeddings are arrays of numbers (vectors) that represent the *semantic meaning* of text. The database allows you to search for \"similar meanings\" rather than just keyword matches."
        },
        "explanation": "This is how \"Chat with your PDF\" apps work."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "LLMs are probabilistic, not deterministic. They act as \"autocomplete on steroids.\" \nThey can confidently generate completely false facts (**Hallucinations**). Applications must have verification steps or human-in-the-loop safeguards."
        },
        "explanation": "Never use an LLM for math or medical advice without guardrails."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**WebGPU**. \nIt acts as a modern bridge to the GPU, designed to match next-gen APIs like Vulkan/Metal. It unlocks massive parallel compute power for running larger AI models directly in the browser."
        },
        "explanation": "WebGPU is pivotal for the future of in-browser AI inference."
