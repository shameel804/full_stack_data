        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "No, it works **alongside** JavaScript. \nWasm is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It allows you to run languages like **C++, Rust, or Go** on the web at near-native speed."
        },
        "explanation": "JS is the glue, Wasm is the muscle. Use Wasm for heavy tasks (video editing, physics engines)."

        "ques": "Why is Wasm faster than JavaScript for heavy computation?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "1.  It is **pre-compiled** binary (faster to decode). \n2.  It is **strictly typed** (no JIT optimization guesswork). \n3.  It has predictable performance characteristics."
        },
        "explanation": "JavaScript JIT is amazing, but it can de-optimize unexpectedly. Wasm is consistent."

        "ques": "Why is **Rust** often the preferred language for writing WebAssembly modules?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "Rust has **no Garbage Collector** (unlike Go or C#). \nThis results in extremely small Wasm binaries because you don't have to ship a heavy runtime inside the file. It also provides memory safety without overhead."
        },
        "explanation": "Small binary size = Fast load times."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**No.** It is a W3C standard supported by all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) since 2017. It is as standard as CSS."
        },
        "explanation": "Applications like Figma, Google Earth, and Photoshop Web rely entirely on Wasm."

        "title": "Accessing the DOM 🌳",
        "ques": "Can Wasm code directly modify the DOM (e.g., `document.getElementById`)?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "Currently, **No** (not directly). \nWasm only does math/logic. To touch the DOM, it must call \"imported\" JavaScript functions which do the work. (Though the Interface Types proposal aims to fix this)."
        },
        "explanation": "Crossing the boundary between JS and Wasm has a slight cost, so keep interactions "chunky"."
