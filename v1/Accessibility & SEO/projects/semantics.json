        "ques": "Why is using `<article>` better than using `<div class=\"article\">`?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "The `<article>` tag carries **semantic meaning**. It tells the browser and assistive technologies that the content inside is a self-contained composition (like a blog post). A `div` has no meaning; it is just a generic container."
        },
        "explanation": "Semantic HTML improves Accessibility (screen readers know how to navigate it) and SEO (search engines understand the structure)."
    },
    {
        "title": "Heading Hierarchy 🧱",
        "ques": "Explain the rule of **Heading Hierarchy** (`h1` through `h6`). How many `h1` tags should a page typically have?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **h1:** Represents the main topic of the page. There should typically be **only one** per page.\n*   **h2-h6:** Represent sub-sections. They must be nested logically (don't skip from h2 to h4).\n\nScreen readers use headings to generate a \"Table of Contents\" for quick navigation."
        },
        "explanation": "Don't use headings for styling (e.g., making text big). Use them for document structure."
    },

        "title": "Landmark Regions 🗺️",
        "ques": "HTML5 introduced landmark elements that define major regions of a page. List **three** such elements.",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "Common landmarks include:\n1.  `<header>` (Banner)\n2.  `<nav>` (Navigation)\n3.  `<main>` (Main content)\n4.  `<footer>` (Content info)\n5.  `<aside>` (Complementary content/sidebar)"
        },
        "explanation": "Users can jump between these regions instantly. Using `<div id=\"header\">` does not provide this navigation capability unless you add `role=\"banner\"`."
    },
    {
        "title": "Buttons vs. Links 🔗",
        "ques": "From a semantic perspective, when should you use an `<a>` tag vs. a `<button>` tag?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **`<a>` (Anchor):** Use when valid navigation is happening (moving to a new URL or page section).\n*   **`<button>`:** Use when an action is being performed on the current page (submitting a form, opening a modal, toggling a menu)."
        },
        "explanation": "Misusing these confuses users. If it looks like a button but goes to a new page, it should be an `<a>` styled as a button."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "They create a semantic association. `<figcaption>` provides a visible caption that is programmatically linked to the image inside the `<figure>`. Screen readers know that the text describes that specific image."
        },
        "explanation": "It relates the image to its context explicitly."
