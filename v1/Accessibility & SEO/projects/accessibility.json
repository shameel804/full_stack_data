            "content": "*   **WCAG:** Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. It is the international standard for web accessibility.\n*   **POUR:**\n    1.  **P**erceivable (e.g., provide text alternatives for images)\n    2.  **O**perable (e.g., keyboard functionality)\n    3.  **U**nderstandable (e.g., readable text, predictable UI)\n    4.  **R**obust (e.g., compatible with screen readers)"

            "type": "text",
            "content": "Option 2: **`alt=\"Search\"`**.\n*   **Reason:** Alt text should describe the **function** of the image, not its visual appearance. A screen reader user doesn't care that it looks like a glass; they care that clicking it performs a search."
        },
        "explanation": "Context matters. If the image is purely decorative, use `alt=\"\"` so screen readers skip it."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "You should never set `outline: none` (or `outline: 0`) on focused elements without providing a replacement style.\n\nThis removes the **Focus Indicator** (the blue ring), making it impossible for keyboard users to know which element they are currently on."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "It is a hidden link (visible on focus) at the very top of the HTML. It allows users to **jump directly to the main content**, bypassing repetitive header links/menus on every page. Without it, a user might have to press Tab 50 times on every page just to read an article."
