        "ques": "What does the command `npx create-react-app my-app` do, and why is `npx` used instead of `npm`?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **Command Action:** It sets up a new React project with a configured build environment (Webpack, Babel, etc.) so you can start writing code immediately without manual setup.\n*   **npx vs npm:** `npm` installs packages. `npx` (Node Package Execute) **executes** a package directly from the npm registry without needing to install it globally on your machine first. This ensures you always use the latest version of the generator."

        "explanation": "CRA (Create React App) is the standard standard way to bootstrap a SPA (Single Page Application)."

        "title": "Understanding JSX",
        "ques": "What is **JSX**, and why can't web browsers understand it directly?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**JSX (JavaScript XML)** is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks like HTML. It allows you to write HTML-like structures directly inside JavaScript code.\n\n**Browser issue:** Browsers only understand standard JavaScript. JSX is **not** valid JavaScript. It must be **transpiled** (converted) by a tool like **Babel** into standard `React.createElement()` calls before the browser can run it."
        },
        "explanation": "JSX makes React code readable and expressive, bridging the gap between logic and UI."

        "ques": "In React, how do you render a React element (e.g., `<App />`) into the actual HTML DOM?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "code",
            "lang": "javascript",
            "content": "import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';\nimport App from './App';\n\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\nroot.render(<App />);"
        },
        "explanation": "React maintains a virtual DOM. `ReactDOM.createRoot` connects this virtual world to the real HTML page (usually a `div` with `id='root'`)."

        },
        "explanation": "Functional components are just JavaScript functions that return JSX. They are the modern standard for writing React components."
