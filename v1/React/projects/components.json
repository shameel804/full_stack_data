        "ques": "Historically, what was the main difference between **Class Components** and **Functional Components** before React Hooks were introduced?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "Before Hooks (React 16.8):\n*   **Class Components:** Could hold **state** (`this.state`) and access **lifecycle methods** (like `componentDidMount`). They were required for complex dynamic logic.\n*   **Functional Components:** Were stateless and purely presentational. They simply accepted props and returned UI.\n\n*Note:* With Hooks, functional components can now handle state and side effects, making class components largely legacy."
        },
        "explanation": "Understanding this history helps when maintaining older codebases."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Props** (short for properties) are inputs passed from a parent component to a child component.\n\n**Data Flow:** Data flows **unidirectionally** (one-way) from top to bottom (Parent -> Child). A child component cannot modify its own props; they are read-only."
        },
        "explanation": "This one-way data flow makes React apps predictable and easier to debug."

        "ques": "What is the special `children` prop in React and how is it used?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "`children` is a special prop that automatically allows components to pass elements *nested inside* their opening and closing tags.\n\n**Usage:** It allows you to create wrapper components (like a `<Card>` or `<Layout>`) that don't know what content they will display ahead of time.\n\n**Example:**\n`<Button>Click Me</Button>` -> Here, the string 'Click Me' is passed as `props.children` to the Button component."
        },
        "explanation": "The `children` prop enables composition, which is a powerful pattern for reusing UI logic."

            "type": "code",
            "lang": "javascript",

        "explanation": "Destructuring props makes it immediately clear what data the component depends on."
