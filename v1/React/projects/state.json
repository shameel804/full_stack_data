        "ques": "How do you declare a state variable named `count` initialized to `0` using the `useState` hook?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "code",
            "lang": "javascript",
            "content": "const [count, setCount] = useState(0);"
        },
        "explanation": "`useState` returns an array with two elements: the current state value (`count`) and a function to update it (`setCount`)."

            "content": "1.  **Mounting:** When the component is first created and inserted into the DOM. (e.g., `componentDidMount`)\n2.  **Updating:** When props or state change. (e.g., `componentDidUpdate`)\n3.  **Unmounting:** When the component is removed from the DOM. (e.g., `componentWillUnmount`)"

        "explanation": "Even if you use Hooks, understanding the lifecycle concept (creation, update, destruction) is crucial for managing side effects."

        "title": "State Updates are Asynchronous",
        "ques": "React state updates are often **asynchronous**. What does this mean if you try to log the state immediately after setting it?\n`setCount(count + 1); console.log(count);`",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "It means the `console.log` will likely print the **old** value, not the new one.\n\nReact 'schedules' the update to happen later for performance reasons. The state variable `count` will only reflect the new value in the *next* render cycle, not immediately in the current function execution."
        },
        "explanation": "This is a common source of bugs for beginners. To react to a state change, use `useEffect`, not a sequential log."
