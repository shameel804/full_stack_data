            "content": "# What is Django? 🎸\n\nDjango is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It was created by a team of developers at a newspaper in Kansas (Lawrence Journal-World) to meet tight deadlines.\n\n## Key Characteristics:\n- **\"Batteries Included\"**: It comes with everything you need (ORM, Auth, Admin, etc.) so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.\n- **Open Source**: Free and open to the public.\n- **Secure**: Built-in protection against common attacks like SQL injection and XSS.\n\n> 🎯 **Fun Fact**: Django is named after the famous jazz guitarist **Django Reinhardt**!"

            "content": "# Why Choose Django? 🚀\n\n## 1. Speed 🏎️\nDjango was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.\n\n## 2. Security 🛡️\nDjango takes security seriously. It provides tools to easily avoid common security mistakes, such as:\n- **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**\n- **Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)**\n- **SQL injection**\n\n## 3. Scalability 📈\nDjango uses a \"shared-nothing\" architecture, meaning you can add hardware at any level (web servers, database servers, caching servers) to handle massive traffic. Giants like **Instagram** and **Pinterest** use Django!"
