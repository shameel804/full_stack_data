            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Sapper** was the original application framework for Svelte (inspired by Next.js).\n**SvelteKit** is the **successor** to Sapper. It is built on Vite (instead of Webpack/Rollup), offering much faster builds and Hot Module Replacement. Sapper is now deprecated."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "You create a file ending in `.js` (or `.ts`) typically named `+server.js` alongside your page.\n\n**Function:** You export a function named matching the HTTP method (e.g., `POST`).\n\n`export function POST({ request }) { ... return json({...}) }`"

            "content": "The **`load`** function runs **before** the page is rendered (both on the server during SSR and on the client during navigation).\n\n**Use:** It fetches the data required for the page. The return value is passed as `data` props to the page component."
        },
        "explanation": "It ensures the component doesn't render until its data is ready, preventing loading spinners."
