        },
        "explanation": "Svelte bundles basic transitions (fade, fly, slide, scale) so you don't need external libraries."

        "title": "In vs Out Transitions",
        "ques": "Can you specify different transitions for entering and leaving the DOM?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Yes.**\n\nUse `in:` and `out:` directives instead of `transition:`.\n\n**Example:**\n`<div in:fly={{ y: 200 }} out:fade>...</div>`"
        },
        "explanation": "This gives fine-grained control over the animation lifecycle."

        "ques": "Why might you use a **spring** animation instead of a standard duration-based easing curve?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Springs** are based on physics (stiffness and damping) rather than time.\n\n**Advantage:** If an animation is interrupted (e.g., user moves mouse back and forth rapidly), springs handle the velocity change naturally and smoothly. Duration-based animations often look robotic or can glitch when reversed mid-flight."
        },
        "explanation": "Physics-based motion feels more organic and high-quality."

        "ques": "What is a **Deferred Transition** (often called `crossfade`) used for in Svelte?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "It allows elements to visually **move between different lists** or containers.\n\n**Example:** When you check an item off a To-Do list, instead of disappearing and reappearing in the 'Done' list, it smoothly glides from its old position to its new position."
        },
        "explanation": "This creates a powerful sense of spatial continuity."
