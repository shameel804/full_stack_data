        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**React/Vue:** Do the bulk of their work in the **browser** (virtual DOM diffing) at runtime.\n**Svelte:** Is a **compiler**. It does its work at **build time**, converting your declarative components into highly efficient, imperative vanilla JavaScript that surgically updates the DOM. There is no Virtual DOM overhead."
        },
        "explanation": "This approach results in smaller bundle sizes and faster initial load times."

        "ques": "What file extension is used for Svelte components, and what are the three standard sections within such a file?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Extension:** `.svelte`\n\n**Sections:**\n1.  `<script>` for JavaScript logic.\n2.  `<style>` for CSS (scoped by default!).\n3.  HTML markup (the template) at the top level (no `<template>` tag needed, unlike Vue)."
        },
        "explanation": "Svelte files feel very close to standard HTML files."

        "title": "Reactive Declarations",
        "ques": "What special JavaScript label syntax does Svelte use to create **Reactive Declarations** (computed values)?",

            "type": "code",
            "lang": "javascript",
            "content": "<script>\n  let count = 0;\n  $: doubled = count * 2;\n</script>"
        },
        "explanation": "The `$: ` syntax is valid JavaScript (a labeled statement), but Svelte interprets it as 're-run this code whenever the referenced values change'."

        "explanation": "Svelte's `bind:` directive is concise and works for component props as well."
