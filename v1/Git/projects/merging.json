            "content": "It happens when the target branch has **not diverged** from the source branch.\n\nGit simply moves the pointer of the target branch forward to the latest commit of the source branch. No new 'Merge Commit' is created."

            "content": "*   **Merge:** Preserves history exactly as it happened. Creates a 'Merge Commit' if branches diverged.\n*   **Rebase:** Rewrites history. It takes your commits and 're-plays' them on top of the target branch, creating a perfectly linear history without merge commits."
