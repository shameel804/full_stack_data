            "content": "To temporarily save changes that are not ready to be committed, so you can switch branches.\n\n**Scenario:** You are working on Branch A. Boss says 'Fix urgent bug on Branch B'. You can't switch because you have messy files. `git stash` saves them on a stack and cleans your directory."

            "content": "*   **`pop`:** Applies the changes and **removes** them from the stash list.\n*   **`apply`:** Applies the changes but **keeps** them in the stash list (useful if you want to apply the same stash to multiple branches)."
