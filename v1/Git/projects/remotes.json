            "content": "**origin** is just the default **alias** (nickname) for the remote repository URL.\n\nInstead of typing `git push https://github.com/user/repo.git main`, you type `git push origin main`."

            "content": "It is a link between a local branch and a remote branch.\n\nIf your local `main` tracks `origin/main`, you can just type `git push` or `git pull` without arguments, and Git knows where to push/pull."

        },
        "explanation": "It sets up the remote 'origin' automatically."
