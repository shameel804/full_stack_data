            "type": "text",
            "content": "Sharding is partitioning a large database across multiple servers (nodes).\n\nInstead of one server holding 1TB of data, you have 10 servers holding 100GB each. A **Shard Key** determines which server a piece of data lives on."

        "explanation": "Essential for horizontal scaling."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "It means every piece of data is stored on **3 different servers**.\n\n**Benefit:** If one server dies, you have 2 other copies. If two servers die, you still have 1 copy. This guarantees high availability and durability."
        },

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Consistent Hashing.**\n\nWhen a new node joins the cluster, only keys that map to its position on the 'ring' need to be moved to it. Without this, resizing a cluster would require reshuffling nearly all data."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "When you read data, the coordinator node checks all replicas.\n\nIf one replica has outdated data (due to a missed write), the coordinator sends the correct data to it in the background to bring it back in sync ('repairing' it)."

        "explanation": "Self-healing mechanism."
