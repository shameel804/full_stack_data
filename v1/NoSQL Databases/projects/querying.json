            "content": "A programming model for processing big data.\n\n1.  **Map:** Filter and sort data on each server locally.\n2.  **Reduce:** Summarize (count, sum) the results from the map step.\n\nIt allows you to run a query across 1000 servers in parallel."

            "content": "Using the **Aggregation Pipeline**.\n\nDocuments pass through a multi-stage pipeline: `$match` (filter) -> `$group` (aggregate) -> `$sort` -> `$project` (shape output).\nIt is the NoSQL equivalent of SQL's SELECT-WHERE-GROUP-HAVING."
