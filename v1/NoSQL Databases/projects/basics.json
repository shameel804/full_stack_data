            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **SQL (Vertical Scaling):** Buying a bigger server (more RAM, more CPU). It has a physical limit.\n*   **NoSQL (Horizontal Scaling):** Adding **more servers** to the cluster. NoSQL is designed to run across cheap commodity hardware."
        },
        "explanation": "NoSQL trades complex joins for massive scalability."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "You don't have to define tables or columns upfront. You can insert a document like `{ \"name\": \"Alice\" }` and later insert `{ \"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 30, \"hobby\": \"Golf\" }` into the same collection.\n\nThe database accepts dynamic structures."
        },
        "explanation": "Great for rapid prototyping or sparse data."

        "ques": "The **CAP Theorem** states a distributed store can only provide 2 of 3 guarantees. What are they?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **C**onsistency (Every read receives the most recent write)\n*   **A**vailability (Every request receives a response)\n*   **P**artition Tolerance (System continues to work despite network failures)\n\nIn reality, Partition Tolerance is mandatory, so you choose between CP (Consistency) and AP (Availability)."

        },
        "explanation": "Eventual consistency is the key trade-off."
