        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Convention over Configuration:** Rails assumes 'sensible defaults' for everything.\n\n**Example:** If you name a model `User`, Rails automatically looks for a database table named `users`. You don't need to write an XML config file to tell it that. This drastically speeds up development."
        },
        "explanation": "Rails optimizes for developer happiness and speed."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Active Record** is the ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) layer.\n\n**Function:** It maps a database row to a Ruby object. You interact with the database using Ruby methods instead of raw SQL.\n`User.find(1)` fetches the user with ID 1."
        },
        "explanation": "It ties database tables closely to classes."

            "content": "*   **Gem:** A library or software package (like an npm package in Node).\n*   **Tool:** **Bundler** (via the `Gemfile`). It manages dependencies and ensures the correct versions are installed."

            "content": "In Ruby, the **last evaluated expression** in a method is automatically returned.\n\n**Example:**\n`def add(a, b) a + b end`\n\nYou don't need to write the keyword `return` explicitly (though you can)."
        },
        "explanation": "This contributes to Ruby's readability, making it read almost like English sentences."
