            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.\n\n**Difference:** It runs **server-side**, providing access to the file system (fs), networking, and operating system API. It does **NOT** have browser-specific APIs like the DOM (document, window) or `alert`."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "Node.js is **single-threaded**.\n\n**Mechanism:** When an asynchronous operation (like reading a file) starts, Node offloads it to the system kernel. The main thread continues executing other code. When the operation finishes, the callback is added to a queue. The **Event Loop** constantly checks this queue and pushes the callback onto the call stack only when the stack is empty."

            "content": "*   **CommonJS (Default):** `const fs = require('fs');`\n*   **ES Modules:** `import fs from 'fs';` (Requires `\"type\": \"module\"` in package.json or using `.mjs` extension)."

            "content": "It is the manifest file for any Node project.\n\n**3 Key Functions:**\n1.  **Metadata:** Project name, version, author.\n2.  **Dependencies:** Lists packages the project needs (`dependencies` and `devDependencies`) so `npm install` knows what to download.\n3.  **Scripts:** Defines command shortcuts (e.g., `npm start`, `npm test`)."
