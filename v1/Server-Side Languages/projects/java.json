        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "The **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** is the engine that runs Java applications.\n\n**Mechanism:** When you compile Java code (`.java`), it turns into **Bytecode** (`.class`). This bytecode is platform-agnostic. The JVM (specific to each OS like Windows, Linux, Mac) translates this bytecode into the machine code of that specific computer."
        },
        "explanation": "You don't compile to an .exe; you compile to a .class file."

        "title": "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)",
        "ques": "Java is a strictly **Object-Oriented** language. What does `public static void main(String[] args)` signify?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "It is the **entry point** of any standalone Java application.\n\n*   `public`: Accessible from everywhere.\n*   `static`: Can be called without creating an instance of the class.\n*   `void`: Returns nothing.\n*   `main`: The specific name the JVM looks for to start execution."
        },
        "explanation": "Everything in Java must live inside a class."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **Lambdas:** Concise syntax for anonymous functions (e.g., `x -> x + 1`), enabling functional programming styles.\n*   **Streams:** A sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations (like `.filter()`, `.map()`, `.collect()`) on collections."
        },
        "explanation": "These features modernized Java, reducing boilerplate significantly."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "Spring solves the complexity of **Enterprise Application Development** through **Inversion of Control (IoC)** and **Dependency Injection**.\n\nInstead of managing creating objects and wiring them together manually, Spring manages the lifecycle of your application components (Beans), handling configuration, database connections, and security automatically."
        },
        "explanation": "Spring Boot takes this further by providing 'opinionated defaults' to get started instantly."
