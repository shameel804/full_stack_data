            "type": "text",
            "content": "**`router.beforeEach`** is a function that runs before every route navigation.\n\n**Use Case:** It is the standard place to check **Authentication**. If the user is trying to access a protected route and isn't logged in, the guard redirects them to the login page."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "Lazy loading delays the loading of a route's component until the user actually visits that route.\n\n**Syntax:** Instead of importing the component at the top, you use a dynamic import function.\n`component: () => import('./views/About.vue')`"

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **Hash Mode:** Uses the URL hash (`#`) to simulate a full URL so the page won't be reloaded when the URL changes. It's uglier but works without server configuration.\n*   **History Mode:** Uses the HTML5 History API to look like a 'real' URL. It's prettier but requires the server to be configured to fallback to `index.html` on 404 errors."
        },
        "explanation": "Always prefer History mode for production apps, but remember to configure your Nginx/Apache server."
