            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Two-Way Data Binding** means that:\n1.  Changes in the **Model** (JavaScript data) update the **View** (UI).\n2.  Changes in the **View** (user input) automatically update the **Model**.\n\n**Directive:** `v-model` is the directive used for this on form elements (`<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`)."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Caching:** Computed properties are **cached based on their dependencies**.\n\nA computed property will only re-evaluate when its reactive dependencies change. A method, on the other hand, will run **every time** a re-render happens. For expensive operations, computed properties are much more performant."

        "explanation": "Use computed properties for 'derivations' of data. Use methods for actions or responses to events."

            "content": "**`v-bind`** is used to dynamically bind one or more attributes, or a component prop to an expression.\n\n**Shorthand:** The colon (`:`).\nExample: `v-bind:href=\"url\"` becomes `:href=\"url\"`."
        },
        "explanation": "You'll see the shorthand `:` almost exclusively in modern Vue codebases."
