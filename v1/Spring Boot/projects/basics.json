        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "Starters are **Dependency Descriptors**.\n\n**Purpose:** Instead of manually adding 10 different `.jar` files (Spring MVC, Tomcat, Jackson, Validation API, etc.) and worrying about version compatibility, you just add **one** dependency (`starter-web`), and it pulls in everything needed for that specific functionality automatically."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "It is a convenience annotation that combines three others:\n1.  **`@Configuration`**: Marks the class as a source of bean definitions.\n2.  **`@EnableAutoConfiguration`**: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings.\n3.  **`@ComponentScan`**: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the current package."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Traditional:** You export a `.war` file and deploy it to an external standalone server like Tomcat or JBoss.\n**Spring Boot:** It uses an **Embedded Server** (Tomcat/Jetty) inside the application. You compile to a generic `.jar` file and run it like a standard Java program (`java -jar app.jar`)."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "Spring Boot attempts to **guess** how you want to configure your application based on the `jar` dependencies you added.\n\n**Example:** If `HSQLDB` is on your classpath, and you haven't manually configured a database connection, Spring Boot automatically configures an in-memory database."
        },
        "explanation": "It prefers convention over configuration."
