        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "It marks a Java class as a **Service** component in the Service Layer.\n\n**Function:** It holds the **Business Logic** of the application. It acts as a specialized `@Component`, allowing Spring to auto-detect it during classpath scanning and inject it into Controllers."
        },
        "explanation": "Technically functionality is same as `@Component`, but semantic meaning is different."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "The recommended way is **Constructor Injection**.\n\n**Example:**\n`@RestController`\n`public class UserController {`\n`  private final UserService userService;`\n`  public UserController(UserService service) { this.userService = service; }`\n`}`"
        },
        "explanation": "Constructor injection ensures the class cannot be instantiated without its dependencies (immutability)."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Singleton.**\n\nOnly one instance of the Service class is created per Spring application context. This single instance is shared and injected wherever it is needed."
        },
        "explanation": "Therefore, services should generally be **stateless**."

        "ques": "What does **`@Transactional`** do when placed on a Service method?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "It wraps the method execution in a database **Transaction**.\n\n**Behavior:** If the method completes successfully, the changes are committed to the DB. If the method throws a RuntimeException, all changes made within that method are **Rolled Back** automatically."
        },
        "explanation": "Crucial for data integrity (e.g., deducting money from sender AND adding to receiver)."
