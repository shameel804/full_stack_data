            "type": "text",
            "content": "It boots up the **entire Application Context** for integration testing.\n\nIt scans for `@SpringBootApplication`, starts the embedded server (if configured), and injects all beans, simulating a real running environment."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "Use **`@MockBean`**.\n\nThis replaces the real bean in the Spring Context with a Mockito mock. You can then define its behavior (e.g., `when(repo.findById(1)).thenReturn(...)`)."

            "content": "It is a **slice test** for the Persistence Layer.\n\nIt configures an in-memory database (H2), scans for `@Entity` classes and Spring Data repositories, and **ignores** the Web layer (Controllers), making it much faster than `@SpringBootTest`."

        "explanation": "Perfect for testing custom repository queries."
