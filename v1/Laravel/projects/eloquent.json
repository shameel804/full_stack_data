            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Eloquent** is Laravel's Object-Relational Mapper (ORM).\n\n**Relation:** Each database table has a corresponding **Model** class. For example, the `users` table maps to the `User` model. You interact with the `User` class to query the `users` table."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Vulnerability:** A user sends a malicious field (e.g., `is_admin=1`) in a form request. If you pass the entire request to `User::create($request->all())`, they become an admin.\n\n**Protection:** The `$fillable` array in the Model defines a **whitelist** of attributes that act as the only ones allowed to be mass-assigned. `is_admin` would be ignored."
        },
        "explanation": "Alternatively, you can use `$guarded` to blacklist fields."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "Migrations are like **Version Control** for your database schema.\n\nInstead of manually creating tables in SQL (which teammates can't see), you write PHP code (`Schema::create...`) that defines the table structure. Running `php artisan migrate` applies these changes consistently across all developer machines and production servers."
        },
        "explanation": "It allows you to evolve your database schema over time."
