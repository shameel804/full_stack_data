            "content": "**PHPUnit** is the default (though **Pest** is becoming popular).\n\n**Config:** `phpunit.xml`. It defines the test suites (Feature vs Unit) and environment variables (e.g., setting `DB_CONNECTION` to `sqlite` for in-memory testing)."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **Unit Test:** Tests a small, isolated piece of code (like a single method) without booting the Laravel application or hitting the database.\n*   **Feature Test:** Tests a larger slice of the application (like an HTTP request). It boots the Laravel app, hits a route, and asserts the response/database state."

            "content": "It ensures a clean state for every test method.\n\n**Mechanism:** It migrates the database before the test runs and uses **Database Transactions** to roll back changes after each test finishes. This ensures Test A doesn't leave data that breaks Test B."

        "explanation": "Essential for reliable testing."
