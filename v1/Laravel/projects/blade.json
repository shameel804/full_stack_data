        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "Blade allows you to use its concise syntax (like `{{ $var }}` or `@if`) while still compiling down to plain PHP code.\n\n**Key Feature:** Blade template files (`.blade.php`) are pre-compiled and cached until they are modified, meaning they add essentially **zero overhead** to your application."
        },
        "explanation": "Standard PHP inside HTML is messy; Blade is clean."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "1.  **Directives:** In the master layout, define a section with `@yield('content')`.\n2.  **Child:** In 'home.blade.php', use `@extends('layouts.app')` and `@section('content') ... @endsection`.\n\nThis injects the child's content into the master layout's placeholder."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "It is a reusable piece of UI (like an Alert box or a Button).\n\n**Syntax:** If you create `resources/views/components/alert.blade.php`, you can use it anywhere via the tag `<x-alert type=\"error\" message=\"Failed!\" />`. It promotes UI consistency like React/Vue components."
        },
        "explanation": "Modern Blade heavily emphasizes components over partials."
