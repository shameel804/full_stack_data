            "content": "**Artisan** is the command-line interface included with Laravel.\n\n**Usage:** `php artisan make:controller UserController`\n\nIt boosts productivity by generating boilerplate code, running migrations, scheduling jobs, and clearing caches. You rarely write a file from scratch manually."

        "explanation": "Don't forget to cache your config in production: `php artisan config:cache`."
