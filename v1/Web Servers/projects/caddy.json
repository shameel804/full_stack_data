        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Automatic HTTPS.**\n\nCaddy automatically obtains and renews SSL/TLS certificates (via Let's Encrypt or ZeroSSL) for your sites by default. You don't need `certbot` or cron jobs; Caddy handles it all out of the box."
        },
        "explanation": "Secure by default."

        "title": "Caddyfile",
        "ques": "Describe the syntax of a **Caddyfile** compared to Nginx or Apache config.",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "The **Caddyfile** is designed to be human-readable and concise.\n\n**Example:**\n`example.com {\n  reverse_proxy localhost:3000\n}`\n\nThis simple block sets up HTTPS, redirects HTTP to HTTPS, and proxies traffic to your app. Equivalent Nginx config would be 20+ lines."
        },
        "explanation": "It focuses on the most common use cases being easy."

        "ques": "Caddy is written in **Go**. How does this affect its deployment?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "Being written in Go means Caddy compiles to a **single static binary** with no dependencies.\n\n**Deployment:** You can just download the single `caddy` executable file and run it on any Linux, Mac, or Windows machine without installing libraries or runtimes."
        },
        "explanation": "This makes it incredibly portable."

        "title": "JSON Config API",
        "ques": "Besides the Caddyfile, Caddy has a native **JSON API**. What does this allow you to do?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "It allows you to update the server's configuration **dynamically** via REST API calls without restarting the server.\n\n**Use Case:** Ideal for platforms that need to provision new domains or routes on the fly (like a SaaS hosting provider)."
        },
        "explanation": "Caddyfile is actually converted to this JSON format internally."
