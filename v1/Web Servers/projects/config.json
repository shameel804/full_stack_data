        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Virtual Hosting** allows a single web server (one IP address) to host **multiple different websites** (domain names).\n\nThe server inspects the `Host` HTTP header of the incoming request to decide which directory (site) to serve."
        },
        "explanation": "Without this, you'd need a separate physical server for every website."

        "title": "MIME Types",
        "ques": "Why must a web server be configured with correct **MIME Types**?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "The **MIME Type** (Content-Type header) tells the browser how to handle the file.\n\n**Example:** If you send a `.css` file but label it `text/plain`, the browser won't apply the styles. If you send a `.json` file as `text/html`, Javascript might not parse it correctly."
        },
        "explanation": "Servers usually have a `types.conf` file mapping extensions to types."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **`root`:** Appends the request URI to the path. `location /img/ { root /var/www; }` -> `/var/www/img/file.jpg`.\n*   **`alias`:** Replaces the location part. `location /img/ { alias /var/www/images/; }` -> `/var/www/images/file.jpg`."

        "explanation": "Use `alias` when the file system path doesn't match the URL path structure."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "Configuration files are often checked into version control (Git).\n\n**Best Practice:** Use **Environment Variables** to inject sensitive values at runtime. Nginx and Apache have modules/syntax to read system environment variables."
        },
        "explanation": "Keep your secrets separate from your config."
