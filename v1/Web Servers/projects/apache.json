        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "Apache typically creates a **new thread or process** for each incoming connection.\n\n**Downside:** As traffic spikes (C10k problem), the memory consumption grows linearly with the number of connections. Eventually, the server runs out of RAM and slows down or crashes."
        },
        "explanation": "Newer versions (Event MPM) improve this, but it is Apache's historical legacy."

            "content": "**`.htaccess`** is a decentralized configuration file allowing you to override server settings for a specific directory (and its subdirectories).\n\n**Use Cases:** URL rewriting (mod_rewrite), setting redirects, enabling password protection, or blocking specific IP addresses."

        "explanation": "It's powerful but can slow down the server since Apache checks for it in every directory."

            "content": "Through **Dynamic Loadable Modules**.\n\n**Example:** `mod_ssl` (for HTTPS), `mod_rewrite` (for URL manipulation), `mod_proxy` (for proxying).\n\nAdmins can enable or disable these modules to customize the server's capabilities."
