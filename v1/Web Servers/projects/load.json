            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **Layer 4 (Transport):** Balances based on IP address and Port (TCP/UDP). It doesn't look at the packet content.\n*   **Layer 7 (Application):** Balances based on content (URL, Cookies, Headers). It can route `/video` to video servers and `/message` to chat servers."

        "explanation": "Layer 7 is smarter but slower (cpu intensive)."

            "content": "They allow the LB to know if a backend server is down.\n\nThe LB regularly pings `/health`. If a server fails to respond (200 OK), the LB stops sending traffic to it until it recovers. This prevents users from hitting a dead server."

        "explanation": "Automatic failover."
