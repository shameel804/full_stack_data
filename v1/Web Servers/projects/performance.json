        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Keep-Alive** keeps the TCP connection open for multiple requests.\n\n**Benefit:** Without it, the browser would have to perform a new TCP Handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and SSL Handshake for *every single image* on the page. Keep-Alive allows reusing the same connection, drastically reducing latency."
        },
        "explanation": "Opening connections works expensively."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "A **CDN** caches your static content (images, CSS, JS) on servers located geographically close to the user.\n\n**Benefit:**\n1.  **Lower Latency:** Data travels a shorter distance.\n2.  **Offloading:** The request never hits your origin server, freeing up your server's resources to handle dynamic logic."

        "explanation": "Cloudflare and AWS CloudFront are popular CDNs."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "It is the process of distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers.\n\n**Purpose:**\n1.  **Scalability:** No single server has to handle all traffic.\n2.  **Redundancy:** If one server fails, the load balancer stops sending traffic to it, keeping the site online."
        },
        "explanation": "Common algorithms include Round Robin and Least Connections."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**HTTP/1.1:** suffers from Head-of-Line blocking (browser can only send ~6 parallel requests).\n**HTTP/2:** allows **Multiplexing**—sending multiple requests and responses in parallel over a *single* TCP connection simultaneously.\n\n**Result:** Pages with many small files load much faster."
        },
        "explanation": "You need HTTPS to use HTTP/2."
