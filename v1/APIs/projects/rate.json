            "content": "**Token Bucket:**\n1.  Imagine a bucket that gets filled with tokens at a constant rate (e.g., 1 token per second).\n2.  Every time a user makes a request, they must take a token from the bucket.\n3.  If the bucket is empty, the request is rejected.\n\n**Feature:** This allows for short **bursts** of traffic (using up accumulated tokens) while maintaining a steady average rate."

            "content": "**Infrastructure** (e.g., Nginx, Redis, or API Gateway).\n\n**Why:** It stops the request **before** it hits your expensive application logic or database. Handling it in app code consumes resources just to say 'No'."
