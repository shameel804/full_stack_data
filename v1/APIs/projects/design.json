        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "Consistency reduces confusion for developers consuming the API.\n\n**Standard:** JSON typically uses **camelCase** (`firstName`).\n**Standard:** URL path segments typically use **kebab-case** (`/user-profiles`).\n\nMixing styles (e.g., returning `first_name` in one endpoint and `lastName` in another) frustrates users."

        "ques": "When an API error occurs, why should you return a structured JSON response (e.g., `{ \"error\": \"...\" }`) along with the HTTP status code?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "An HTTP status code (like 400 Bad Request) tells *what* category of error happened, but not *why*.\n\n**Structured Body:** A JSON body like `{ \"code\": \"INVALID_EMAIL\", \"message\": \"Email format is incorrect\" }` allows the client application to display a meaningful error message to the user."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Swagger/OpenAPI** is a specification for describing RESTful APIs.\n\n**Benefit:** It generates interactive documentation automatically. Developers can try out endpoints directly in the browser, seeing exactly what parameters are required and what the response looks like, without writing any code."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "APIs change. If you change the data structure in a way that breaks existing clients (Breaking Change), you need a way to support the old clients while offering new features.\n\n**Strategy:** `/v1/users` works for old apps. `/v2/users` works for the new app. Without this, you are stuck supporting legacy mistakes forever."
