            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **REST:** The server defines the endpoints. The client hits specific endpoints (e.g., `/users`, `/posts`) and gets fixed data structures.\n*   **GraphQL:** The client sends a **Query** describing exactly what data it needs. The server returns exactly that data.\n\n**Result:** Eliminates Over-fetching (getting too much data) and Under-fetching (needing multiple requests)."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **Query:** Used to **read** data (equivalent to GET).\n*   **Mutation:** Used to **write** (create, update, delete) data (equivalent to POST/PUT/DELETE)."

        "explanation": "Technically both are POST requests over HTTP, but semantically they differ."

        "ques": "What is the role of the **Schema** (`typeDefs`) in GraphQL?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "The **Schema** is the contract between client and server. It strongly types every piece of data available.\n\n**Example:**\n`type User { id: ID!, name: String, posts: [Post] }`\n\nUnlike REST, where the shape of data is implicit, GraphQL enforces structure validation automatically."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "A **Resolver** is a function responsible for fetching the data for a specific field in the schema.\n\n**Mechanism:** If a query asks for `user { posts }`, the `posts` resolver is called to fetch the posts (from a DB, another API, etc.) for that user."
        },
        "explanation": "Resolvers are the 'controllers' of the GraphQL world."
