        "ques": "Ionic is a **Hybrid** framework. What is the container that runs an Ionic app on a phone?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "It runs inside a **WebView** (essentially a headless browser). \nThe app is just a regular website (HTML/CSS/JS) wrapped in a native container (Capacitor or Cordova) that displays it fullscreen."
        },
        "explanation": "This allows you to use 100% web tech (Angular, React, Vue) to build mobile apps."
    },
    {
        "title": "Capacitor ⚡",
        "ques": "What is the role of **Capacitor** (or Cordova) in an Ionic app?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "Capacitor acts as the **Bridge** between the Web View and the Native features. \nStandard JS cannot access the Camera or Geolocation natively. Capacitor provides a JS API (`Camera.takePhoto()`) that calls the underlying Native code."
        },
        "explanation": "It empowers the web code to gain superpowers."

        "title": "Performance: Native vs. Hybrid 🏎️",
        "ques": "Historically, Hybrid apps were slower than Native apps. Why? How has this gap closed?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **Why:** JS is single-threaded and the DOM is slow. Rendering complex lists in HTML/CSS is slower than native UI.\n*   **Improvement:** Modern WebViews are incredibly fast (JIT compilation), and phones are powerful. For 90% of CRUD apps, the difference is negligible today."
        },
        "explanation": "Unless you are building a 3D game, Ionic/Hybrid performance is typically sufficient."

        "ques": "Ionic provides a library of UI components (like `<ion-card>`). What technology are these based on?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Web Components** (StencilJS). \nThis means they work in any framework (React, Angular, Vue) or plain HTML. They encapsulate their own styles and logic using the Shadow DOM."
        },
        "explanation": "Standards-based components ensure future-proofing."

        "title": "One Codebase 🦄",
        "ques": "What is the primary business advantage of choosing Ionic over Native (Swift/Kotlin)?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Code Reuse.** \nYou can build the Web App, iOS App, and Android App from **one single codebase**. \nWith Native, you need two separate teams (iOS Team + Android Team). Ionic drastically reduces development cost and time."
        },
        "explanation": "The trade-off is performance for efficiency."
