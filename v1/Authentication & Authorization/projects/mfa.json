            "type": "text",
            "content": "1.  **Something you KNOW:** Password, PIN.\n2.  **Something you HAVE:** Smartphone app (Google Authenticator), YubiKey, SMS code.\n3.  **Something you ARE:** Biometrics (Fingerprint, FaceID)."
        },
        "explanation": "True MFA requires at least two *different* types of factors."

        "ques": "How does **TOTP** (like Google Authenticator) work offline?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "Both the server and the user's phone share a **Secret Key** (exchanged via QR code initially). The code is generated by hashing this Secret Key combined with the **Current Time**.\n\nSince both devices know the time and the secret, they generate the same 6-digit code independently without needing internet."
        },
        "explanation": "This is why your phone's clock must be accurate for MFA to work."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "SMS is vulnerable to **SIM Swapping**.\n\n**Attack:** An attacker calls your mobile carrier, impersonates you, and convinces them to transfer your phone number to a new SIM card they control. They then receive all your MFA codes."
        },
        "explanation": "NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) discourages the use of SMS for 2FA."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "They are a set of one-time-use codes generated when you set up MFA.\n\n**Usage:** They are the *only* way to regain access to your account if you **lose your MFA device** (phone). Users are instructed to print them out or save them in a safe place."
        },
        "explanation": "Without these, losing a phone can mean permanent account lockout."
