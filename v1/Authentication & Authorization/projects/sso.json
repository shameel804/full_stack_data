        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**SSO** allows a user to log in **once** (e.g., to their Google or Microsoft work account) and automatically gain access to all authorized applications (Slack, Zoom, Jira) without entering credentials again for each one.\n\n**Benefit:** Improves user experience/productivity and reduces 'password fatigue'."
        },
        "explanation": "It also simplifies disabling access when an employee leaves (just disable one central account)."

        "title": "SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)",
        "ques": "What is **SAML** primarily used for?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**SAML** is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between an **Identity Provider (IdP)** and a **Service Provider (SP)**.\n\nIt is the dominant standard for legacy enterprise SSO."
        },
        "explanation": "Modern web apps are moving towards OIDC, but SAML is still huge in corporate IT."

        "title": "Identity Provider (IdP)",
        "ques": "In an SSO setup, what is the role of the **Identity Provider (IdP)**?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "The **IdP** is the trusted service that holds the user directory and verifies credentials.\n\n**Examples:** Okta, Auth0, Google Workspace, Azure AD.\n\nThe application (Service Provider) trusts the IdP to say 'This is John Doe, and he is authenticated'."
        },
        "explanation": "The app outsources 'logging in' to the IdP."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Yes.**\n\nIt works on the same principle as Enterprise SSO. Facebook acts as the Identity Provider. You authenticate with Facebook, and they vouch for your identity to the third-party app (Spotify, Pinterest, etc.)."
        },
        "explanation": "It leverages the OIDC/OAuth protocols."
