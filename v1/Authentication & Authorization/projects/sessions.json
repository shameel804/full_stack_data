            "content": "A **Session ID** is a random string generated by the server that uniquely identifies a specific user session.\n\n**Transmission:** It is almost always stored in a **Cookie** in the user's browser and sent with every HTTP request automatically."

            "content": "It is an attack where an attacker steals a valid user's **Session ID**.\n\n**Result:** The attacker injects this ID into their own browser requests. The server thinks the attacker *is* the victim and grants full access to their account."

            "content": "*   **Secure:** The cookie will only be sent over encrypted **HTTPS** connections. It won't be sent over plain HTTP.\n*   **HttpOnly:** The cookie **cannot** be accessed by JavaScript (`document.cookie`). This prevents XSS attacks from stealing it."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Sticky Sessions Issue:** Default sessions are stored in the memory of Server A. If the next request hits Server B, Server B doesn't know about that session.\n\n**Solution:** You must use a centralized session store (like **Redis** or a Database) that all servers connect to."
        },
        "explanation": "Stateless tokens (JWT) solve this by keeping data on the client, but sessions provide more control (easy revocation)."
