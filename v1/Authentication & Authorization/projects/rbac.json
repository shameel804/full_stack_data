            "type": "text",
            "content": "In **RBAC**, permissions are not assigned to users directly. Instead:\n1.  **Permissions** (e.g., 'edit post', 'delete user') are assigned to **Roles** (e.g., 'Editor', 'Admin').\n2.  **Users** are assigned one or more **Roles**.\n\nThis makes managing permissions for large numbers of users scalable."

        "explanation": "Adding a new team member is just 'assign Role', not 'assign 50 specific permissions'."

            "content": "It states that a user (or process) should only be given the **minimum** levels of access (permissions) necessary to perform their job functions, and nothing more.\n\n**Benefit:** If that account is compromised, the attacker's potential damage is limited."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**RBAC** is coarse-grained (Role = Admin).\n**ABAC** is fine-grained and dynamic. It makes decisions based on attributes of the user, resource, and environment.\n\n**Example:** \"User can edit this document IF (User.department == Document.department) AND (Time is between 9am-5pm).\""

            "content": "An **ACL** is a table that tells a computer operating system (or app) which access rights each user has to a particular system object (like a file or directory).\n\n**Example:** File A -> { User1: Read, User2: Read/Write }."

        "explanation": "It works well for specific object-level permissions."
