        "ques": "What is the main difference between **Template-Driven** and **Reactive Forms** regarding where logic is defined?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **Template-Driven:** The logic resides mainly in the **HTML template**. You use directives like `ngModel` to create the form model implicitly. (Simpler, good for basic forms).\n*   **Reactive Forms:** The logic resides explicitly in the **Component Class**. You create the tree of `FormControl` and `FormGroup` changes in TypeScript and bind them to the HTML. (More robust, scalable, and testable)."
        },
        "explanation": "Reactive forms are generally preferred for complex enterprise applications."

        "title": "FormGroup and FormControl",
        "ques": "In a Reactive Form, describe the relationship between a **FormGroup** and a **FormControl**.",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **FormControl:** Tracks the value and validation status of an **individual** form input (like a text box for 'Email').\n*   **FormGroup:** Tracks the status of a **collection** of FormControls. If one control in the group is invalid, the entire group is considered invalid."
        },
        "explanation": "This composite structure allows you to build complex forms with nested validation sections."

        "answer": {
            "type": "code",
            "lang": "typescript",
            "content": "email: new FormControl('', [Validators.required, Validators.email])"
        },
        "explanation": "Validators are just simple functions that return null (if valid) or an error object (if invalid)."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "1.  Import `FormsModule` in your module.\n2.  Use the `[(ngModel)]` syntax on the input.\n3.  Give the input a `name` attribute (e.g., `name=\"email\"`). This is required for the form to track the control."
        },
        "explanation": "Forgetting the `name` attribute is the #1 error beginners face with template-driven forms."
