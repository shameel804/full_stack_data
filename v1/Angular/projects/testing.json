        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **Jasmine:** The **testing framework**. It provides the syntax for writing tests (e.g., `describe()`, `it()`, `expect()`).\n*   **Karma:** The **test runner**. It launches a browser (like Chrome), runs the tests, and reports the results back to the CLI."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**TestBed** is the primary API for configuring an Angular testing module.\n\n**Function:** It mimics an Angular `@NgModule`. It allows you to configure the dependency injection system, declare components, and import modules specifically for the testing environment, isolating the component being tested."

        "explanation": "TestBed.configureTestingModule({ ... }) is the first line of almost every Angular test."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **ComponentFixture:** A wrapper around the component under test and its template. It gives you access to the component instance and the DOM element.\n*   **`fixture.detectChanges()`:** Manually triggers Angular's change detection cycle. In tests, change detection isn't automatic; you must call this to update the view after setting data."
        },
        "explanation": "Without `detectChanges()`, your test DOM will stay empty even if your component has data."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **Traditional:** **Protractor** (built specifically for Angular, now deprecated/sunset).\n*   **Modern Alternative:** **Cypress** (or Playwright). These tools are faster, more reliable, and offer a better developer experience for testing the entire application flow in a real browser."
        },
        "explanation": "The Angular team officially recommends moving away from Protractor."
