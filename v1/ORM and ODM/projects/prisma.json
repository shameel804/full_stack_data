            "type": "text",
            "content": "The **`prisma.schema`** file.\n\nIt defines your database connection, generator settings, and your data models using a custom DSL (Domain Specific Language).\n`model User { id Int @id ... }`"

            "content": "It **generates** a bespoke TypeScript Client based on your schema.\n\nIf you have a customized query `select: { name: true }`, the return type is automatically adjusted to *only* contain `name`. Accessing `.email` will throw a compile-time error."
