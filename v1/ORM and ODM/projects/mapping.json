            "content": "**No.**\n\nSQL tables don't inherit from other tables.\n\n**ORM Mapping Strategies:**\n1.  **Single Table:** One big table for Parent+Children, with a discriminator column.\n2.  **Joined Table:** Separate tables for Parent and Child, joined by ID.\n3.  **Table Per Class:** Duplicate columns in separate tables."
        },
        "explanation": "Single Table is fastest; Joined is most normalized."
