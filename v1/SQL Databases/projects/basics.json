            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Relational Database Management System**.\n\n**Characteristic:** Data is stored in **Tables** (rows and columns). Crucially, these tables can be **Related** to each other (e.g., A 'Customer' table relates to an 'Orders' table via a Customer ID), allowing for structured data and integrity enforcement."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "A **Primary Key (PK)** is a column (or set of columns) that **uniquely identifies** every single row in a table. It cannot contain NULL values and must be unique.\n\n**Example:** `user_id` in a `users` table."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "A **Foreign Key (FK)** is a column in one table that points to the Primary Key of another table.\n\n**Purpose:** It enforces **Referential Integrity**. You cannot insert an Order for a Customer ID that doesn't exist in the Customers table. It links the data together."

            "content": "A **Schema** is the blueprint or structure of the database. It defines the tables, the columns in each table, the data types (integer, varchar, boolean), and the relationships/constraints between them."
        },
        "explanation": "In SQL, schema is rigorous. In NoSQL, it is flexible."
