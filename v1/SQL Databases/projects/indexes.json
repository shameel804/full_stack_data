        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "To **speed up read operations** (SELECT queries).\n\n**Analogy:** Without an index, finding a row is like reading every page of a book (Full Table Scan) to find a word. With an index, you look at the Index/Glossary at the back, get the page number, and go straight there."
        },
        "explanation": "Indexes drastically reduce query time from seconds to milliseconds."

        "title": "Trade-off",
        "ques": "If indexes make reads faster, what is the **downside**?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "They make **Write operations** (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) **slower**.\n\n**Reason:** Every time you change data, the database has to update the Table *and* update the Index structure. Also, indexes consume extra Disk Space."
        },
        "explanation": "Don't index every column. Only index columns you frequently search or filter by."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**B-Tree (Balanced Tree).**\n\nIt keeps data sorted and allows for searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time (O(log n))."
        },
        "explanation": "This works for =, >, <, >=, <= range queries."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "An index on **multiple columns** (e.g., `(Last_Name, First_Name)`).\n\n**Order Matters:** It works like a phone book sorted by Last Name, then First Name. You can use it to search by `Last Name` alone, or `Last Name AND First Name`. You **cannot** efficiently use it to search by `First Name` alone."
        },
        "explanation": "This is the 'Leftmost Prefix' rule."
