            "content": "If you transfer $100 from Alice to Bob, two things happen:\n1.  Deduct $100 from Alice.\n2.  Add $100 to Bob.\n\n**Atomicity:** Both must succeed, or neither happens. If step 2 fails (crash), step 1 is **Rolled Back** so money isn't lost."

        "ques": "What is the purpose of Transaction **Isolation Levels** (e.g., Read Committed vs Serializable)?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "They control the visibility of changes made by one transaction to other concurrent transactions.\n\n**Trade-off:** Higher isolation (Serializable) prevents all data inconsistencies but significantly slows down performance (locking). Lower isolation is faster but risks 'Dirty Reads' or 'Phantom Reads'."
        },
        "explanation": "Read Committed is the default for many DBs (Postgres, SQL Server)."
