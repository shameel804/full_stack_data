            "content": "**Multi-Version Concurrency Control.**\n\nIt allows multiple readers and writers to access the database simultaneously without blocking each other. Writers don't block readers, and readers don't block writers. Postgres keeps multiple 'versions' of a row to ensure each transaction sees a consistent snapshot."
