            "type": "text",
            "content": "1.  **InnoDB:** The default. Supports Transactions (ACID), Foreign Keys, and Row-Level Locking. **ALWAYS use this.**\n2.  **MyISAM:** Older. Fast for reads but notoriously bad for data integrity (no transactions) and uses Table-Level Locking (slow writes)."

            "content": "**Logical Replication via Binary Log (binlog).**\n\nMySQL records every data change event (INSERT, UPDATE) in a `binlog` file. Replicas read this file and re-execute the statements to stay in sync."

            "content": "MySQL traditionally did **not** support **Full Outer Joins**.\n\nYou had to simulate it by UNION-ing a Left Join and a Right Join.\n(Note: MySQL 8.0 has added many modern features like CTEs and Window Functions, closing the gap)."

        "explanation": "Postgres is generally considered more feature-rich."
