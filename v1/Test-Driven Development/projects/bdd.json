            "type": "text",
            "content": "1.  **Feature:** A high-level description of a software capability (e.g., \"Shopping Cart Checkout\"). It groups related scenarios.\n2.  **Scenario:** A specific example or path through that feature (e.g., \"Checkout with an empty cart\" or \"Checkout with a discount code\"). It acts as a single test case."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "A **Step Definition** is a block of code (in Python, Java, JS, etc.) that maps a Gherkin sentence (like \"Given the user is on the login page\") to actual automation code (e.g., `driver.get(\"/login\")`). Regular expressions are often used to match the text."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "BDD does **not** replace TDD. \n*   **BDD:** Focuses on the **system behavior** and acceptance criteria from the user's perspective (high-level).\n*   **TDD:** Focuses on the **unit implementation** and code design (low-level).\n\nTypically, a BDD scenario (failing acceptance test) drives the outer loop, while TDD loops are used to implement the components needed to satisfy that scenario."
        },
        "explanation": "BDD helps ensure you are building the **right thing** (validation), while TDD ensures you are building the **thing right** (verification)."

        "explanation": "**Scenario Outlines** combined with **Examples** tables allow you to run the same test logic against multiple inputs, reducing duplication."
