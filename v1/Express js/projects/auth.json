            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Passport** is modular authentication middleware.\n\n**Feature:** It supports hundreds of **Strategies** (e.g., `passport-local` for username/password, `passport-google-oauth`, `passport-jwt`). You can plug in any strategy you need without rewriting your entire auth flow."
        },
        "explanation": "It standardizes the request object: `req.user` is automatically populated."
