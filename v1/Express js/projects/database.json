            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Mongoose.**\n\nIt provides schema validation, model building, and query building logic on top of the native MongoDB driver, making it easier to work with data in a structured way."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Knex.js** is a 'middle ground' SQL query builder.\n\nIt allows you to write SQL-like queries in JavaScript (`knex('users').where('id', 1)`) that work across multiple database types (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite), but it doesn't impose a heavy object-relational mapping layer like full ORMs do."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Separation of Concerns.**\n\nRoutes should handle HTTP (requests, responses, status codes). Database logic (queries) should live in a **Service** or **Repository** layer.\n\n**Benefit:** You can test your DB logic independently, and if you change databases, you don't have to rewrite your controllers."
