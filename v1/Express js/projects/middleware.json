            "content": "Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request (`req`), response (`res`), and the **next** function in the cycle.\n\nThey can:\n1.  Execute any code.\n2.  Modify the request and response objects.\n3.  End the request/response cycle.\n4.  Call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware."

            "content": "The application will **hang**.\n\nThe request will remain pending indefinitely (until it times out) because Express doesn't know what to do next. You must always either terminate the request (`res.send`) or pass it on (`next()`)."
