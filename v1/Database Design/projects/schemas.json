            "content": "A schema design with a central **Fact Table** (containing metrics/events like Sales) surrounded by dimension tables (Time, Product, Store).\n\nIt looks like a star. It is optimized for analytical queries (OLAP) rather than transactional processing (OLTP)."

            "content": "It is a **normalized** version of a Star Schema.\n\nThe dimension tables are split into further sub-dimension tables (Product -> Brand -> Category). This saves space but requires more complex joins to query."
