            "content": "It removes **Partial Dependency**.\n\nIt applies only to tables with a **Composite Key**. All non-key columns must depend on the *entire* primary key, not just part of it.\n\n**Example:** In specific `(Student, Course)` table, `CourseName` depends only on `Course`, not `Student`, so it should move to a separate `Courses` table."
